			<p>Hello!
			My name is Miguel Abisai Bernal, I go by Abisai (A-be-sai). I am excited to learn about computer coding. I have no experience in this field and I am looking forward to this challenge. I have a BA in International Relations and a Masters in International Studies. I also have plenty of customer service experience. Last year I moved back to San Diego after living in San Francisco and abroad for six years. I am excited to be back and learn everything about coding. </p>
			<br>
			<p>When I can, I like to travel to anywhere that I can find a cheap plane ticket. I like to explore and push myself to enjoy and learn from people and other cultures. When in my trip adventures, I take the roll of a photographer and try my best to capture unique moments that will last a life time. One thing to know about me is that I have never try India food. A lot of people tell me I should. Maybe soon. </p>
